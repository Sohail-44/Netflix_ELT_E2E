# StayOnFlix # 
Brief Description : 
StayOnFlix is a project to do deep analytics of Netflix to detect and prevent content fatigue-driven churn in netflix users
and recommend appropriate interventions to minimize revenue loss and improve overall content recommending.

I will be  merging real Netflix data of shows and movies + simulated synthetic data of Netflix churn from Kaggle Datasets in order to
simulate time-based viewing behavior, scroll fatigue, content repetition, interest dip post trendy shows/series and boredom signatures.

More updates coming soon...
